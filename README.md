# NotEasy
The purpose of this tool is to facilitate book searches from Douban, Goodreads, ZLibrary, and Google, specifically catering to users who prefer simple and traditional Chinese.

My personal inclination leans towards the realm of philosophy, politics, and economics literature. To acquire recommendations in these areas, I rely on the four distinct sources. Thus, I have taken it upon myself to develop this tool that will aid in identifying the finest books within these domains.
